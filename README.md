## Project Management Requirements

### 50 Tasks in Trello or ZenHub, before coding

- Planning is always a critically important part of a project. Breaking down your project into tasks that need to be completed saves an enormous amount of time.

### Blueprint completed with quality sketches and unit test plan

- Plan out your features, endpoints and schemas, just like you did in your personal project.
- Create sketches of what your basic site layout will be, on computer or paper. They don't have to be design mock-up quality (try adobeXD though it free <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>.
- Writing a bunch of unit tests when you've finished your project doesn't really benefit you at all. Plan out what parts of your site you can unit test ahead of time.
- <a href="https://github.com/DevMountain/simulation-1/blob/master/PLANNING_SHEET.md">If you arent sure where to start, reference back to the SIM-1 planning sheet</a>

### Daily Standups

- Daily standups are a crucial part of the popular "Agile" way of approaching projects.
- Talk about what you got done the day prior, what you plan on getting done today, and anything you see that will block your path.
- This should take about 1-3 minutes per team member.
  Standups are to be done with the group's mentor, so make sure to coordinate.
- Stand ups should be done with your Project Manager once in the morning and once after lunch, (work times out with the project manager)

### Everyone in the group has at least 15 commits

- It is important that everyone in the group is contributing. A good way to track that is by ensuring everyone in the group has a certain number of commits.
- Some employers will look at your code, so it's important that it's clear which contributions are yours.

## Social Requirements

### Treat this project like a job

- You are closer to having a developer job than ever before. As such, you should treat this project like a job. At a job, it is naturally expected of you to show up on time and do your work. At a job, it is expected of you to act civilly and cooperate with your coworkers. There are always social consequences to your actions, whether positive or negative. Your team members are likely to help you get contacts for getting jobs in the future and give you references... or not.
- If you don't treat this like a job and your teammates complain about your behavior, this could result in you not meeting this requirement.

**<p style='color: red'>Failure to meet these requirements may result in you needing to undergo an alternate badging process</p>**
